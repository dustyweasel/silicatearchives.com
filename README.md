# silicatearchives.com
the granite database of the future

This isn't a real repository.  Just advertising a java project called silicatearchives.com.  I think I'll have it online July 2020. I think people are going
to use it and I'm not sure if making the code public is a good idea.  If you need code samples let me know.
